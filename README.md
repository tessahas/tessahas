## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software engineering student passionate about solving real-world problems at the intersection of technology, math, and human systems. I thrive when I’m **reverse-engineering an algorithm**, **building data pipelines**, or **learning the inner mechanics of financial instruments**.

This page is a home for the things I’ve coded, explored, or broken and fixed again.

## 🔨 Recent Projects

### 🩺 **Dietary Health App with HIPAA-Compliant Encryption**
*Java (Spring Boot), Flutter, PostgreSQL*  
Led encryption design for a healthcare app that helps patients manage chronic dietary conditions. Built a custom application-level scheme (AES-256 + RSA-256) to enforce strict field-level and role-based access control—without relying on commercial key management services.

### 📊 **OpenBio Facial Verification Pipeline**
*Python, Bash*  
Automated benchmarking for a secure open-source biometrics library. Implemented DET curve analysis and integrated a new database (DoppelVer) to improve robustness against false positives.

### 📅 **EventHive (Hackathon Project)**
*Python, Svelte*  
A web scraper/calendar aggregator that collects university events from club and academic social media accounts. Designed with overwhelmed students (and free food lovers) in mind.

## 🧭 Outside the Terminal

I'm also a varsity sailor, student rep, and event organizer. If I’m not coding or studying basis risk, I’m probably somewhere on the water!
